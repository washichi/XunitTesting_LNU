Description

Assignment 1.2:

Language of implementation: C++
Framework for unit-testing: Google Test
Framework for Mocking:      Google Mock
Code coverage tool:         GNU Gcov & Lcov

Project:


What sort of project you are going to code (For example a dice game)
There are however some minimum requirements that we want you to achieve. You should see these as guidelines to conduct a project of the right size and type.
In order to get a higher grade you need to show that you have:

Made commits to GitHub using a specific pattern that shows that you have worked using TDD, (at least 20 commits.)
Make sure you are working in “Test Driven Development” manner. Make a git-commit after each step:
Red: Write a test that fails. Make a commit with the word “RED” in commit message.
Green: Change the implementation so that the test-suite succeeds. Make a commit with the word “GREEN”.
Refactor: Rewrite the code. Make a commit with the word “REFACTOR”.
At some point do a coverage measurement. If you make a code-coverage measurement do a commit separately for that named “COVERAGE”, make sure you save the measurement as a file in your GitHub repository. Could be a text file or a screenshot-image.

Show a project of proper size and complexity that illustrates your proficiency in the techniques.
Our criteria is:
In the final project show at least 4 SUT-classes with dependencies. The more classes the better
You have used dependency injection
You needed to mock or isolate dependencies so that only bugs in the class under test trigger a failing test and not a bug in other classes.
Objects of classes are created, not only during setup
The project has a UI (Console, GUI, or web)
Understand TDD, unit-testing, mocking and coverage
Show expertice in the use of the XUnit framework, Mocking framework, coverage tool
Test behaviour using mocks
Show the use of different type of mocking
Use a Code coverage tool
